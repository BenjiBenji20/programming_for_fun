# 🖥️ CLI Playground – Fun CLI Projects for Practicing Programming

Programming doesn’t always have to be serious or driven by business needs. Sometimes, the best way to **learn and enjoy coding** is by building small projects that run directly in the **Command Line Interface (CLI)**—sparking back your interest through hands-on work with logic, processing user inputs, handling errors, and more, all before diving into the abstractions of frameworks!

This repository is a collection of CLI-based projects, ranging from **beginner to advanced**, implemented in various programming languages. It's designed to:

* Reignite your passion for programming 🎉
* Strengthen your understanding of **core programming concepts** (OOP, data structures, algorithms, error handling)
* Help you practice **processing user inputs, managing edge cases, and handling files/system interactions**
* Showcase the raw beauty of coding **across languages**, without relying on heavy frameworks

💡 Each project focuses on logic and interactivity—whether it’s managing tasks, tracking data, organizing files, or building simple games—all built with fundamental tools and libraries.

## Applications

Here’s a list of the CLI projects in this repository, ordered from beginner-friendly to more advanced:

1. CLI-Based Task Manager – A simple to-do list app for adding, viewing, deleting, updating and completing tasks.

Feel free to explore each project's folder for the source code, instructions on how to run it, and notes on the concepts covered.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/BenjiBenji20/programming_for_fun.git`
- Navigate to a project folder and follow the individual README or run instructions (e.g., `python main.py` for Python projects, or compile/run for others like Java or Rust).
- No heavy dependencies required—most projects use standard libraries or minimal setups.

## Contributing

If you'd like to add your own CLI project or improve existing ones, pull requests are welcome! Just ensure it fits the spirit: fun, educational, and framework-free.

Happy coding! 🚀
